# Collaborative Text Editor

This is a simple collaborative text editor built with React for the frontend and Node.js/Express with Socket.IO for the backend. The program allows multiple users to edit the same document in real timeâ€”changes in one browser window instantly appear in all others.

## How to Run

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
2. Start the frontend client in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in multiple browser tabs or windows to see real-time collaboration in action.

## Technology Usage in Group Projects

Real-time collaborative technology like this will enable team members and eventual users to edit documents or code together, brainstorm ideas, or manage shared notes simultaneously, improving productivity and teamwork in group projects in use and while building the project.
