## Google Sign-In with MySQL
This directory serves as the root directory for a test project that allows the user to sign-in through Google's authentication service, and have their email recorded in a MySQL database.

The frontend code can be found in `public/index.html`, and the server code is in `server.js`.

Setup:
Run `npm install` after cloning the repository (project requires node v14 at minimum). This will download and install all dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to launch the server on `localhost:3000`.
