This program allows for somebody to type into an input field on the left side of the screen and receive back a manipulated output.
You can run this file (index.html) by opening it in a web browser (html file).
This technology will be used in our group project since the point of our project is to take an input and compile it into an output which is very similar to what this html file does.
