## Google Sign-In with MySQL

This was made by Robby Lawrence (rlawren9) for the HelloPlus assignmet.

This directory serves as the root directory for a test project that allows the user to sign-in through Google's authentication service, and have their email recorded in a MySQL database.

The frontend code can be found in `public/index.html`, and the server code is in `server.js`.

Currently, this server is being hosted on the team web server and viewers can test the authentication by going to `underbranch.org/helloplus/rlawren9`. Most of this code is going to used for the login, which is why I chose this as my HelloPlus project.
