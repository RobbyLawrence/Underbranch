Note: Issue with git blame is causing several files in the signin directory to appear such that Aaron created them. I wrote all files in Underbranch/signin/. For example, I modified  signin/index.html at b55b790, which occurred before 8b16a41, and yet it still says that Aaron created the file there. Not sure what happened there.

Running git blame on each file says Aaron created them. However, it says that he has a separate account that ISN'T a collaborator on the repository that made the commits, despite him never touching the files nor having a separate account.
