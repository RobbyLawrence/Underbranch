# Sprint 3
Aaron Brown, A-aronCBrown, Overleaf Clone / Underbranch

## What you planned to do
- I planned to integrate the collaborative features into the main branch - issue #34
- I planned to work with Robert to reconfigure the website to allow for the function of the collaborative features - issue #41
- I planned to perform general maintenance on the server to make sure that the collaboration was seamless for end users - issue #42

## What you did not do
- I was unable to perform maintenance on the server to make sure that the collaboration was seamless for end users - issue #42

## What problems you encountered
- Lack of knowledge regarding web development
- Lack of time / having to work around my job, other classes, hobbies, exercise, etc.
- Too much to learn - In terms of understanding github as well as other UnderBranch functions

## Issues you worked on
- [issue #34](https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/34)
- [issue #41](https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/41)
- [issue #42](https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/42)

Files you worked on
- Underbranch/editor/dev-server.js
- Underbranch/editor/src/collaborative.js
- *** minor changes to other files interacting with the main two ***

## Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I love the convenience offered by Github Copilot. I use Copilot and Gemini to lay out high-level frameworks for the collaborative features. Simultaneously, I used these AI utilities to zero in on specific errors and minute oversights. When I really just didn't understand how something worked (i.e. Web sockets or Git commands), I could use AI, specifically GH Copilot, to get a generally helpful, mostly effective implementation of that feature very quickly without having to go through the hassle of researching it.

## What you accomplished
I was able to fully incorporate the code allowing for collaboration into the main Github branch. Eventhough the collaborative services are not currently functional (lack of code maintenance, Cloudflare struggles, etc.), I feel that I have made a significant contribution to the project in the last two weeks. Sorting through errors and making the code function is what everyone tends to remember, but just getting the code in there is half the battle, no doubt.
