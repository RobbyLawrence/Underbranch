# Sprint 3

- Name: Paul Davis
- Github ID: pau1davis
- Group: Underbranch

### What you planned to do
* Merge Collaboration with Main. [Issue #33](https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/33)
* Directory Cleanup. [Issue #39](https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/39)
* Remove Preview Setting from Tab. [Issue #40](https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/40)

### What you did not do
* We got everything we need to do for this sprint done on time. I will include some goals for sprint 4.
* Re-image XPS (backend server) for CloudflareD consistency. 
* Basic Cleanup/Maintenance before final presentation.

### What problems you encountered
This sprint, I had difficulty merging our collaborative feature with the main branch. It was particularly difficult to figure out how to get socket.io to communicate properly on our backend server. CloudflareD and nginx introduce complications when it comes to running servers on our backend server.

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I didn't use any AI to code on this sprint. However, it helped me understand what approach I needed to take to get socket.io to work with us. It was useful for research on this sprint.
### What you accomplished
For this sprint, I was responsible for merging our collaborative feature into the main branch. Basically, I had to get our collaborative feature that worked in a different branch with a different directory/file flow to cooperate with our current system and more importantly, the Underbranch server. I also did a little bit of general cleanup, such as removing old directories/files and small visual enhancements for the website.
