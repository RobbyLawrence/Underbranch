# Sprint 3

Name: Brett Dowling
Github ID: Brett-Dowling
Group Name: Underbranch

### What you planned to do

* I wanted to work more towards the error checker that I had made in sprint 2.
* I wanted to add a toggling light and dark mode for the LaTeX editor.


### What you did not do

* I did not completely finish the error checking to the complete version for the final product.

### What problems you encountered

I had trouble with getting the error checker to work exactly how I wanted it to. I also had some issues
when making the dark and light mode. First when I made it it would only toggle the pdf to be light or
dark mode and would not change the editor version at all. I had to fix that which took some additional
coding and debugging.

### Issues you worked on

I worked on the progress of the error checker: https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/37
I worked towards creating the dark and light mode: https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/36
I worked on the editor bug in the dark and light mode: https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/38 


### Files you worked on

* Underbranch/editor/dist/bundle.js
* Underbranch/editor/src/bundle.js.map
* Underbranch/editor/index.html
* Underbranch/editor/src/App.js
* Underbranch/editor/src/LaTeXEditor.js
* Underbranch/editor/src/Toolbar.js

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used ChatGPT and Claude.ai to help with the development of the error checking and the light and dark mode.

### What you accomplished
The main thing I accomplished was the fully functioning dark and light mode. I think this makes the user experience of 
the webpage much better and helped our team present a much cleaner product.
