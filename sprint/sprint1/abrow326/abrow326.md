# Files you worked on

 - All files in "production-server" directory

# Use of AI and/or 3rd party software

In this sprint, I used AI to push mass amounts of code into the repo with the intention of using it to integrate collab editing into the frontend editor 

-- Github Copilot

# What you accomplished

I was able to fully develop collaborative editing on a conceptual basis using a simple textbox which can be interacted with using a web socket by multiple people at the same time. This concept can be applied to the frontend editor to allow many people to work on the same project at the same time.
