# Sprint 2

Name: Brett Dowling
Github ID: Brett-Dowling
Group Name: Underbranch

### What you planned to do

* I wanted to add a simple error checker for the editor
* I wanted to finish out the LaTeX highlighting and autocompletion
* I wanted to help move the working pdf compiler to the web version of the app


### What you did not do

* I could not finish the LaTeX highlighting and auto completion to my liking.
* I also could not move in the working simple version to the web version.

### What problems you encountered

I had trouble with pretty much every single step of the process during this sprint. Our
web text editor kept crashing so it was super inconsistent on what you could see of what you were
working on and getting accomplished. It felt like making the simplest adjustment to any part of the
project was very tedious to achieve.

### Issues you worked on

I worked on the simple error checker: https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/23
I worked towards moving the complier to the webpage: https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/27
I worked towards the final version of the LaTeX editor: https://github.com/RobbyLawrence/Underbranch/issues/25


### Files you worked on

* Underbranch/editor/index.html
* Underbranch/editor/src/index.js
* Underbranch/editor/src/App.js
* Underbranch/editor/src/latexChecker.js
* Underbranch/editor/src/LaTeXEditor.js

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used ChatGPT and Claude.ai to help with the development of the error checking and to help know what packages that I needed to 
download and implement to achieve my goals.

### What you accomplished
I made main thing I accomplished was the basic error checking. Once integrated into the webpage that will achieve one
of our main goals of real-time error checking in a web-based LaTeX document.
