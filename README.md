## How to Run/Description

LaTeX editor is fully online at www.underbranch.org/editor. Users can download either a .tex or .pdf file of the file they have edited in Underbranch. Users can compile their LaTeX document directly in the editor. Underbranch also allows for collaborative editing, meaning that users can join up in a room and write/edit the same document. Of course, users still have access to the download and compile options in a collaborative room.
